# Cursed OS-Dev Environment

idk why I made this, it was awhile ago but it exists lol

but if you for some reason wanted to develop an OS using Limine,the compiler being Clang + NASM,the build system being xmake,on Windows and run the OS via creating a VHD through Diskpart, well this is for you lol

its very janky though, please don't use this
